// GENERATED FIXTURE SKELETON -- spm-fixture-v2
//
// Declarations lifted out of this group's transplants so that ONE fixture serves every role in
// it. That is the point of the file: the same values mount for both endpoints of every
// contrast, so a measured difference is attributable to the edit and not to the scaffolding.
//
// HOW THE VALUES GOT HERE. They are not authored by hand and not invented by the generator.
// Each one is resolved by a pre-registered hierarchy and the rule that fired is recorded, per
// binding, in this group's `fixture_provenance.json`:
//
//   relocated        the value really was in the application; `spm isolate` moved it here
//                    verbatim. Do not "tidy" one -- it is a measurement input.
//   upstream_literal not relocated, but the repository declares it at this group's anchor
//                    commit; taken verbatim, with `file@sha` recorded.
//   protocol_constant neither of the above; the committed table in `config/fixture_policy.json`.
//                    Collection cardinality is one declared constant, corpus-wide.
//   maximal_branch   a bool/enum/nullability that decides WHICH subtree renders takes the arm
//                    that renders more. This one OVERRIDES a relocated value, and says so.
//
// WHAT REMAINS TRUE REGARDLESS OF WHO OR WHAT FILLS A SLOT:
//
//   * The same values serve every role in the group. That is what makes the stubbing
//     symmetric across a pair, which is what makes a measured difference attributable to
//     the edit rather than to the scaffolding.
//   * Fixed collection cardinality. A list of 3 in one place and 10 in another is a change
//     in tree size, and tree size is the dependent variable.
//   * Deterministic values only: no `Random`, no `DateTime.now()`, no I/O, no network, no
//     animation controllers left ticking.
//   * Keep `extends` and `implements` clauses exactly as they are. `spm analyze` decides
//     widget versus value object by walking the supertype chain, so a stand-in that stops
//     extending its widget base silently moves allocations into `valueObjectAllocCount`.
//   * Fill before measuring, then freeze. A fixture edited after seeing a result is a
//     fixture the result cannot be defended against.
//
// A slot the hierarchy cannot resolve keeps its `// TODO: value` and is NOT guessed.
// `scripts/fixture_gate.py` then refuses the group, so an unfilled fixture cannot reach the
// device.
//
// This file is a pure function of the mine plus two committed tables, and is regenerated as
// long as it is untouched. The first HAND edit makes it yours: the screen sees the file no
// longer matches the hash it recorded, copies it into config/authored_fixtures/, and never
// generates over it again -- including after a prune deletes this directory, which is how
// the hash alone used to lose an edit. `scripts/authored_fixtures.py --list` says which
// groups the corpus no longer derives from the mine; `--release <group>` hands one back.
// ignore_for_file: unused_import, unused_element, unused_field

// SEEDS -- the values the generated `initState` reads, for which `spm isolate`
// could build none. It declares each of these `late` and leaves it unassigned on
// purpose: a fabricated default would be measured as though it were the value that
// was really there. Assign one below and every role in this group gets it.

// LIFTED BINDINGS -- the scope's initial state, which `spm isolate` 0.7.0 moves out
// of the application and into a fixture block of its own. Most of these carry the
// value that was really there, relocated rather than invented, and are reproduced
// here verbatim: do not "tidy" one, it is a measurement input.
//
// The ones marked TODO are the exception. Where the binding came from the
// application and no value existed to move, the block gets an empty collection or a
// null, and how many elements you put in one IS tree size -- the dependent variable.
// That is a decision, and it is why they are hoisted: filled in once here, the whole
// group mounts from identical values, so a measured difference is attributable to
// the edit rather than to the scaffolding.
